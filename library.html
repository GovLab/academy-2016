        <p> In this paper, the authors argue that a more systematic ontology for data visualization to ensure the successful communication of meaning. &quot;Visualization begins when someone has data that they wish to explore and interpret; the data are encoded as input to a visualization system, which may in its turn interact with other systems to produce a representation. This is communicated back to the user(s), who have to assess this against their goals and knowledge, possibly leading to further cycles of activity. Each phase of this process involves communication between two parties. For this to succeed, those parties must share a common language with an agreed meaning.</p>

        <p>Advances in technology have greatly increased the potential for policymakers to utilize the personal data of large populations for the public good. However, the proliferation of vast stores of useful data has also given rise to a variety of legislative, political, and ethical concerns surrounding the privacy and security of citizens’ personal information, both in terms of collection and usage. 

Gary Wolf gives a 5-min intro to an intriguing new pastime: using mobile apps and always-on gadgets to track and analyze your body, mood, diet, spending -- just about everything in daily life you can measure -- in gloriously geeky detail.

        <p>Advances in technology have greatly increased the potential for policymakers to utilize the personal data of large populations for the public good. However, the proliferation of vast stores of useful data has also given rise to a variety of legislative, political, and ethical concerns surrounding the privacy and security of citizens’ personal information, both in terms of collection and usage. In this topic, learn about the challenges regarding the governance and regulation of personal data in order to assuage individuals’ concerns regarding the privacy, security, and use of their personal information.

In this episode, legendary photographer Rick Smolan turns his lens toward big data—the idea that insightful, cohesive narratives exist within all the data and information generated by our everyday actions, purchases, and web searches. What does big data say about you? What is this information used for?</p>
